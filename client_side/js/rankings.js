          Snippet 3 requires more context understanding than Snippet 4. Also, there is weird syntax in Snippet 3; line 11 takes an argument in a getter, which is not common and passing null looks unnecessary.

                It is hard for me to distinguish which one is easier/harder to understand. They have straightforward logic that I am familiar with, and I don't think the usage of a visitor or nested ifs or loops makes one harder/easier to understand than the others.

              The reason I ranked Snippet 2 after Snippet 7 is that I am not familiar with a URI's scheme and why implementing that logic (in Snippet 2) is enough to check if it is remote. Snippet 7 is straightforward to understand if we remember/know the quadratic formula.

              Snippet 6 is harder to understand for me because I don't know what the bit shifts are doing to check or determine the sequence length in UTF-8. Snippet 4 is easier to understand, despite it being unclear what regionMatches is doing â€” overall, I understand what the method is doing.

              ðŸ’¡ They both implement simple string validation logic. \`isRemote\` has a shorter, simpler set of rules that it implements, so I ranked it lower. However, I don't think either of these are very difficult: both were pretty trivial to write a specification for.

            <div class="tooltip-box" style="top: 60px; right: -160px;">
              There is a big gap between these, in my view. \`isValidProjectName\` is simple string validation, but the other two snippets are implementations of more complex (but reasonably well-known!) algorithms that are pretty easy to recognize.

              These two snippets are moderately complex string and float algorithms, respectively. I don't differentiate between them, since both are tricky to get right but doing something pretty well understood.
              (prev:Snippets 4, 5, and 7 are pretty similar, in the sense that each implements a well-known algorithm that I immediately recognized. However, all three are pretty complicated algorithms to get right.)

              These three snippets are actually pretty similar: all are implementations of some kind of simple specification that's a bit tricky to get right in practice. I'm actually not even confident that \`deleteRecursively\` is correct, though, which is why I ranked it above the other two: the relevant Java APIs are quite confusing and easy to get wrong. I think this implementation might leak a file descriptor?

              \`isMachineTypeDefined\` required me to do true bottom-up reasoning to figure out what it was doing, unlike \`deleteRecursively\`.<br>
              (prev:Then comes Snippet 3: it also required me to reason through it, since it wasn't clear what it was for just from reading through it once. However, it was noticeably easier to figure out what Snippet 3 is doing compared to Snippet 6.)

              Both snippets require bottom-up reasoning. However, \`encodedLength\` requires more domain knowledge to make sense of, since it seems obvious to me that Java programmers should know how the API for the language itself works at a basic level (e.g., "what's a field?" is not a question any Java programmer is going to ask), but \`encodedLength\` requires understanding UTF-8 vs UTF-16, which many Java programmers won't have had to deal with.
