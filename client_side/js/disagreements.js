<p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> Martin and Oscar placed Snippet 2 clearly above 4 and 7, while Nadeeshan tied them. The question is whether Snippet 2â€™s brevity justifies being distinct, or whether it belongs tied with 4 and 7.</p>

    <p><strong>Martin:</strong> "We broadly agree... Oscar and I agree this one is a little bit trickier than Snippet 1... I think we'll agree here on Snippet 1 at the bottom, and this one above it."</p>
    <p><strong>Oscar:</strong> "Yeah, maybe I'm giving too much importance to checking scheme jar/file... need to see other snippets."</p>
    <p><strong>Nadeeshan:</strong> "I agree with Oscar... despite that uncertainty, the purpose of the method remains clear... I would change rank of Snippet 2 from 1 to 2."</p>

<p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> Martin: 4 > 7; Oscar: 7 > 4; Nadeeshan: 4 = 7 and also tied 4 with 2. The issue is whether <code>regionMatches</code> creates a barrier or is trivial to resolve, and if Snippet 4 should be distinct from Snippet 2.</p>

<p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> Martin ranked 5 above 7, while Oscar and Nadeeshan ranked 7 above 5. The question is whether reliance on the Visitor pattern makes Snippet 5 harder, or whether clear structure/naming keeps it easier.</p>

<p><strong>Disagreement:</strong> Snippet 7 is in conflict with multiple snippets. Martin: 5 > 7 and 4 > 7; Oscar: 7 > 5 and 7 > 4; Nadeeshan: 7 > 5 and 7 = 4, also tied 2 = 7. The open question is whether 7 should be clearly harder than 5, tied with 4, and/or distinct from 2.</p>
