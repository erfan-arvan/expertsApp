This description doesn't even make sense but it may be that someone needs that at some point (?)",
      "comprehensibility": "The comprehensibility is extremely bad. The factors that make it hard to understand are:\n\n- UTF-8 is a string encoding. From line 1 you would expect the length of the input CharSequence to be encoded as a UTF-8 string, but instead the method returns an integer.\n- line 7 gives a condition to a loop that depends both on the length of the input CharSequence as well as the specific values contained in this sequence. Not clear why ascii values above 0x80 would not be considered.\n- Checking the 0x80 value (128) we can assume that most characters given in a CharSequence will be under 128, hence line 12 will in most cases throw an index out of bounds exception.\n- Line 14 uses bit shift which can be clever and optimised for some operations but normally doesn't lead to easy understanding of code in most scenarios.\n- Line 16 calls another function that probably does something very similar to the current function but it's unclear what we could expect from a function that uses an unreliable index and the input sequence as parameters.\n- In general the function is extremely cryptic and most likely incorrect"

I don't think overall idea is too hard to follow once you realize it’s computing UTF-8 length from UTF-16 characters, and the early loop that skips ASCII makes sense. The harder part is the bit-level expressions like ((0x7f - c) >>> 31), which aren’t immediately obvious unless you’ve seen or worked with that style of optimization before. The lack of comments around the more complex arithmetic also makes it take a little longer to understand and discern what’s going on.
